## Intro

Hello, my name is Daniel Moore and I am a software developer that primarily focuses on programming in Javascript. As it stands I currently have a year working with the language and am working with React/Next frameworks. My goal with this blog is to share my own thoughts on subjects and give insight into what I've been learning and what I am currently working on.

## Direction

I am planning on using this of course as a personal developer blog to document my current ongoing projects but I will also be posting about new technologies I come across and my journey interacting with them.

Given my amount of experience, currently standing at a bit over one year, I don't expect to be putting [DEV.to](https://dev.to/t/blog) or [Daily Dev](https://daily.dev/blog) out of business. More so I just wanted a space to cleary detail and outline some thought processes of my own and maybe, just maybe, give back to this amazing community of developers that has helped me so much.

## Forewarning

Did I mention that I'm not the most experienced programmer yet? Apart from that I am also new to blogging and while I am not new to journaling, the thought of putting my thoughts into the interwebs is a bit exciting. I am new to a lot of this and I hope that at the least a bit of my personality would shine through this project as I take a leap into the unknown.

## Thank you for your time and I hope you have an amazing day!
